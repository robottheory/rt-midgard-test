  description: >-
    The Midgard Public API queries THORChain and any chains linked via the Bifröst
    and prepares information about the network to be readily available for public users.
    The API parses transaction event data from THORChain and stores them
    in a time-series database to make time-dependent queries easy.
    Midgard does not hold critical information.
    To interact with BEPSwap and Asgardex, users should query THORChain directly.

        The values report the state at the end of each interval.

        History endpoint has two modes:
        * With Interval parameter it returns a series of time buckets. From and To dates will
          be rounded to the Interval boundaries.
        * Without Interval parameter a single From..To search is performed with exact timestamps.


        * Interval: possible values: 5min, hour, day, week, month, quarter, year.
        * count: [1..400]. Defines number of intervals. Don't provide if Interval is missing.
        * from/to: optional int, unix second.

        Possible usages with interval.
        * last 10 days: `?interval=day&count=10`
        * last 10 days before to: `?interval=day&count=10&to=1608825600`

        * Days between from and to. From defaults to start of chain, to defaults to now.
          Only the first 400 intervals are returned:
          `interval=day&from=1606780800&to=1608825600`

        Pagination is possible with from&count and then using the returned meta.endTime as the
        From parameter of the next query.

        Possible configurations without interval:
        * exact search for one time frame: `?from=1606780899&to=1608825600`
